# Projects
Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my projects.

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| [Rendering 360ยบ Images into Paintings](google.com) | Dec 2023 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, ??? | The goal of the project was to transform entire 360ยบ images into artistic stylizations based on famous painting styles. We stylized the specific regions of interests, such as the sky, while preserving other parts of the original image. In addition to the stylizations, we added a dimension of interactivity, similar to Google Street View, where the image can be rotated 360 degrees. Our project delves into both style and texture transfer methods. This involved implementing neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the TensorFlow model TF-Hub, and employing a patch-based texture transfer algorithm. This project is built on influential works in neural style transfer, drawing inspiration from "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Gatys et al., Efros et al.'s "Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer" and "Exploring the Structure of a Real-Time, Arbitrary Neural Artistic Stylization Network" by Ghiasi et al. |
| [Semantic Parsing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zbVABMVLFNlcY-vYr-oRZtueXgTPKAs4?authuser=1) | Nov 2023 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch | To use an attention-enhanced encoder-decoder model to encode input utterances into vector representations, and then generate the inputs' logical forms using the vector representations. Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176a2piKtrMsFLV2tA9hwRHFMGefoFjpp/view?usp=drive_link) explaining my results. |
| [OffBrandOffWhite](google.com) | May 2023 | Java, Javascript, ReactJS | ??? |
| [Tower of Babel](https://devpost.com/software/tower-of-babel) | Dec 2022 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, nltk, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, keras | The primary goal was to automate the process of classifying newspapers into one of 5 categories (business, tech, politics, sport, and entertainment) based on the text and article title. The secondary goal was to compare the accuracies of the classification using 9 different models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron). Success was defined as achieving a classification accuracy of over 60% for all models. Since all accuracies were above 75%, with a high of 98%, we deemed this project successful. |
