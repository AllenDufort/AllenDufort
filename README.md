# Projects
Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my projects.

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| [JeopardyAI!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bhiLo3uDRYwm3UTqzUcXi4HbY8RRSlyqnlpKwzUBcQY/) | Dec 2024 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, AutoGen, OpenAI | JeopardyAI! is a Jeopardy-inspired trivia game with human players and an AI host. This game allows two human users to compete against each other in a series of trivia questions, following modified Jeopardy-style rules. We designed a multi-agent system, enabling dynamic question generation, gameplay moderation, and seamless scorekeeping between the AI host and players. We also integrated OpenAI and Cluebase APIs to deliver an engaging experience with access to over 350,000 trivia questions. |
| DraftBears Sportsbook | May 2024 | Python, SQLite, JSON | For DraftBears Sportsbook, we sought to explore the dynamics of NBA player performances to enhance our sports analytics and data storytelling capabilities while presenting interesting insights for potential sports fans. We focused on analyzing player statistics across different times of the NBA season to understand the relationship between player metrics and their game outcomes. Specifically, our hypotheses test the correlation between various player performance metrics and their scoring efficiency, game consistency, and impact on the team’s performance. We collected 23762 pieces of data from multiple API sources using Python scripts and SQL. |
| [Rendering 360º Images into Paintings](https://github.com/AllenDufort/csci1290_final/blob/main/README.md) | Dec 2023 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, tensorflow, tensorflow_hub, numpy, matplotlib | The goal of the project was to transform entire 360º images into artistic stylizations based on famous painting styles. We stylized the specific regions of interests, such as the sky, while preserving other parts of the original image. In addition to the stylizations, we added a dimension of interactivity, similar to Google Street View, where the image can be rotated 360 degrees. Our project delves into both style and texture transfer methods. This involved implementing neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the TensorFlow model TF-Hub, and employing a patch-based texture transfer algorithm. |
| [Semantic Parsing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zbVABMVLFNlcY-vYr-oRZtueXgTPKAs4?authuser=1) | Nov 2023 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch | The goal of this project was to use an attention-enhanced encoder-decoder model to encode input utterances into vector representations, and then generate the inputs' logical forms using the vector representations. Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176a2piKtrMsFLV2tA9hwRHFMGefoFjpp/view?usp=drive_link) explaining my results. |
| [OffBrandOffWhite](https://github.com/KYen24/OffBrandOffWhite) | May 2023 | Javascript, ReactJS, Java, MongoDB | This project is a demo of an online retail store that users can buy and sell shoes and clothes. Users can easily find shoes and clothing by filtering based on price and condition, with options to undo or reset filters. Sellers can efficiently upload items with detailed specifications, including product type, size, condition, price, and multiple images, with the ability to preview and manage listings. Additionally, a chat feature facilitates communication between buyers and sellers for transaction logistics, enabling real-time messaging, image sharing, and a user-friendly interface. Finally, a search box empowers buyers to quickly locate specific items with relevant filtering and easy access from any page on the platform. |
| [Tower of Babel](https://devpost.com/software/tower-of-babel) | Dec 2022 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, nltk, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, keras | The primary goal was to automate the process of classifying newspapers into one of 5 categories (business, tech, politics, sport, and entertainment) based on the text and article title. The secondary goal was to compare the accuracies of the classification using 9 different models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron). Success was defined as achieving a classification accuracy of over 60% for all models. Since all accuracies were above 75%, with a high of 98%, we deemed this project successful. |
